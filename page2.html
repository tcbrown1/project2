				<center><p>The Truth is... we're being watched. Constantly. Every hour of the day. Every day of the week. Every week of the year, and then some. I wanted to create a site to beware innocent people like yourself of our circumstances. So here it goes: The government is knowing of everything we do. I wanted to be sure they weren't tracking this site, so I created that first fake page. I know, from individual sources, that usually they have people do a lazy job of checking things like new sites created. They usually see, "Okay nice colors, no harm, nice info... not important." Although I did that, I still have to be safe since there's no undoing this code... In fact, in order to be safe enough to create this site, I had to keep a limit on how long I stayed making it. I also cannot reveal my name at any time. And you. You're very brave if you're still reading. You also have a limited amount of time to stay on these tabs before they check again. I'll keep a timer for you... The safest would be 15-20 minutes tops.

I'm going to be telling you how they watch us, and what to do to stay safe. Most importantly though, giving examples of all the times they do watch us... Click below to continue. After this, there's really no going back.</p></center>
